# Data Storytelling in Tableau

This repository contains the Tableau version of the case studies implemented in Python in the book [Data Storytelling with Generative AI using Python and Altair](https://www.manning.com/books/data-storytelling-with-generative-ai).

This repository aims to demonstrate that you can use the concepts described in the book even with different tools, such as Tableau.
